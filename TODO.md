## Overlap Analysis
- **DashboardController** (yega-dashboard):
  - Interacts with GitHub data, fetching repository details, issues, pull requests, and statistics.
  - Uses `GitHubService` for GitHub-related operations.

- **GitHubAPI** (mcp-orchestrator):
  - Provides methods for fetching repositories, issues, pull requests, commits, and README files.
  - Implements caching and logging for API interactions.

### Merging Strategy
- Evaluate the functionalities of `DashboardController` and `GitHubAPI` to determine which methods to retain or merge.
- Consider consolidating the logging and caching mechanisms to avoid redundancy.
- Ensure that the merged project maintains a clear structure and adheres to best practices for code organization.
