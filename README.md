# Project Name: Overlap Analysis

## Project Overview
The Overlap Analysis project comprises two primary components: `DashboardController` and `GitHubAPI`. The `DashboardController` is responsible for interacting with GitHub data to fetch repository details, issues, pull requests, and statistics. It relies on the `GitHubService` for all GitHub-related operations. On the other hand, the `GitHubAPI` serves as a back-end service that provides methods to fetch various GitHub resources, including repositories, issues, pull requests, commits, and README files. This project aims to create a seamless integration and effective analysis of GitHub data.

## Installation
To get started with the Overlap Analysis project, you'll need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/overlap-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate into your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd overlap-analysis
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
After installation, the project can be utilized to gather and analyze data from GitHub. You can run the application using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

You’ll need to configure your GitHub tokens in order to fetch data. Refer to the [GitHub API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) for instructions on obtaining personal access tokens.

## Features
- Fetch repository details from GitHub
- Retrieve issues, pull requests, and their respective statistics
- Implement caching for optimized API interactions
- Logging mechanisms for tracking API requests

## Dependencies
The project has the following dependencies (found in `package.json`):

- `axios`: For making HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
- `express`: A web framework for building the server.
- `dotenv`: To manage environment variables.

## Project Structure
